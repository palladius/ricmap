This project tries to exhume maps in automated way, possibly Heatmap Layer

with things I';ve done.

Wolf helped me with some URLs. See this:

GeoCommons offers many different data sets. A quick search for 'borders' is all I think you'll need. Here's a dataset called 'World Borders': 
http://geocommons.com/overlays/247342
http://geocommons.com/

And you can use either the Maps API to render the KML for you with:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/layers#KMLLayers

OR you can render the KML with Javascript with:
https://code.google.com/p/geoxml3/

Also have a look at mapsengine light. You can upload your own data from CSV there.

Oh and to find out the country of a specific point you can use the Maps API Geocoder, like in this example: http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/country_explorer/country_explorer.html
